         <h1 id="money-and-capital-markets">Money and Capital Markets</h1>
<p>Money and capital markets are two key components of the financial markets. They both play distinct roles in the economy by providing a platform for the exchange of funds and securities. While they share some similarities, they differ in terms of the time horizon, the type of instruments traded, and their functions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-money-market">1. <strong>Money Market</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>money market</strong> refers to the segment of the financial market where short-term borrowing and lending take place, typically involving instruments that mature within one year or less. It deals with highly liquid and low-risk instruments, ensuring that borrowers can access short-term funding, while investors can park their funds temporarily with minimal risk.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-the-money-market">Key Features of the Money Market:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-Term Financing</strong>: The primary function of the money market is to provide short-term funds to individuals, businesses, and governments.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: Money market instruments are highly liquid, meaning they can be quickly converted into cash with little risk.</li>
<li><strong>Low Risk</strong>: Instruments traded in the money market are considered safe, with minimal risk of default.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates</strong>: The money market helps determine short-term interest rates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-money-market-instruments">Common Money Market Instruments:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treasury Bills (T-Bills)</strong>: Short-term government securities issued to finance national debt.</li>
<li><strong>Certificates of Deposit (CDs)</strong>: Time deposits offered by banks with a fixed interest rate and maturity.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Paper</strong>: Unsecured, short-term debt issued by corporations to finance working capital.</li>
<li><strong>Repurchase Agreements (Repos)</strong>: Short-term borrowing using securities as collateral.</li>
<li><strong>Bankers’ Acceptances</strong>: Short-term debt instruments issued by a firm and guaranteed by a bank.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-capital-market">2. <strong>Capital Market</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>capital market</strong> is where long-term securities, such as stocks and bonds, are traded. It allows businesses, governments, and other organizations to raise long-term funds by issuing equity or debt securities. Capital markets are crucial for long-term financing, offering investors opportunities to buy and sell securities with longer-term maturities.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-the-capital-market">Key Features of the Capital Market:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Financing</strong>: The capital market is focused on raising long-term capital, typically for projects, expansion, or investments.</li>
<li><strong>Risk</strong>: Capital market instruments generally carry a higher level of risk than money market instruments, as they are subject to market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Equity and Debt Instruments</strong>: It involves trading in both equity (stocks) and debt (bonds) instruments.</li>
<li><strong>Market Participants</strong>: Institutional investors, such as pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies, are typically more active in the capital market.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-capital-market-instruments">Common Capital Market Instruments:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stocks</strong>: Equity instruments that represent ownership in a company.</li>
<li><strong>Bonds</strong>: Debt instruments issued by governments or corporations to raise funds.</li>
<li><strong>Preferred Stocks</strong>: Hybrid securities with features of both stocks and bonds, offering fixed dividends.</li>
</ul>
