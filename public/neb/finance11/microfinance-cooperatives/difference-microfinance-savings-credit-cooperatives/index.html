         <h1 id="organization-of-cooperatives">Organization of Cooperatives</h1>
<p>The organization of cooperatives involves a unique structure that emphasizes democratic governance, collective ownership, and decision-making. Unlike traditional business organizations, cooperatives are structured to ensure that their members have an active role in decision-making and the management of the organization. This chapter delves into the key aspects of how cooperatives are organized, from their governance to their management functions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="structure-of-a-cooperative">Structure of a Cooperative</h2>
<p>The structure of a cooperative is designed to promote participation, transparency, and accountability. The main components of cooperative structure include the following:</p>
<h3 id="1-general-assembly-members-meeting">1. <strong>General Assembly (Members&rsquo; Meeting)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> The General Assembly is the highest decision-making body in a cooperative.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Approving the annual report and financial statements.</li>
<li>Electing the Board of Directors.</li>
<li>Deciding on the distribution of profits or dividends.</li>
<li>Approving major business decisions, such as mergers or expansion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-board-of-directors">2. <strong>Board of Directors</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> The Board of Directors is elected by the members from among themselves. They are responsible for the overall governance and strategic direction of the cooperative.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Setting long-term strategies and objectives.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-managementexecutive-committee">3. <strong>Management/Executive Committee</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> The Management or Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the cooperative.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing the Board&rsquo;s strategic decisions.</li>
<li>Managing the cooperative’s resources, such as finances, human resources, and assets.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
